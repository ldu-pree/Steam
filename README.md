# Steam
A fix for steam's case insensitive error

How to:

1- Run the Steam.sparseimage thingy

2- Now open the Steam disk that popped up on your desktop

3- Run the steam.dmg file and drag the steam app into the disk on your desktop

4- open a new terminal window

5- If you are a WTC student run the wtcsetup.sh by typing "sh wtcsetup.sh" otherwise run the normalsetup.sh file

6- Run steam and login

7- To install games go to Steam>Preferences>Downloads>Library Folders>Add Library Folder

8- Now add a folder anywhere you have space since the Steam disk is only 5GB

9- Right click the new folder you added and make it your default

10- Now install your games and enjoy :D
